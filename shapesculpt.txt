Workflow Steps


1. Read Input Data

Implement functions to read SVG and CSV files from the testCases folder.
For CSV files, use the read_csv function you've developed to extract polyline data.



2. Process Each Test Case

For each test case (input file) in testCases, perform the following:
Curve Fitting: Apply cubic Bezier curve fitting on the polylines extracted from the input data.
Regularization: Apply regularization rules to make the shapes more geometrically regular.
Symmetry Detection: Check for symmetries in the shapes and mark them accordingly.
Shape Completion: If any shapes are incomplete due to occlusion, attempt to complete them.



3. Generate Output

Convert the processed curves back to SVG format, using cubic Bezier curves for smoother representation.
Save the processed paths as CSV files for easy analysis and verification.



4. Save Results

Save the generated SVG files in the output folder with corresponding filenames to the input files.
Save any additional output data, such as processed CSV files or visualizations, in the output folder.



5.Validation and Testing

Compare the output files with expected results, if available. Use automated tests to ensure the accuracy of the output.
Visualize the results to manually verify the correctness of the curve fitting and regularization.
